# MyStadium-frontend

This is the frontend portion of our application. This is where we render the styling and other features of the app that is not found in the backend portion.

# Getting Started

To begin you'll want to clone down both this Frontend repository and the Backend. The instructions below will focus on getting the Frontend up and running. I'd recommend you completely set up the Backend first to avoid a "server in use error." Instructions for how to actually play the game are located below.

# Installing

- In your text editor's terminal run 'open index.html'
